            Rosé's debut single album, entitled R, was released on 12 March 2021. Upon release, with 41.6 million views in 24 hours on her lead single "On the Ground", she broke the almost 8-year record of former labelmate Psy's "Gentleman" for the most viewed South Korean music video of a soloist in 24 hours. "On the Ground" peaked at number 70 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the highest-charting song by a Korean female soloist in the US. The song also debuted and peaked at number 1 on both the Global 200 and Global Excl. U.S. charts, the first song by a Korean solo artist to do so in the charts' histories. R also set the record for the highest first-week sales by a Korean female soloist with 448,089 copies sold. On 24 March, Rosé received her first-ever music show win as a soloist with her single "On the Ground" through South Korean cable music program, Show Champion, and would go on to win five more. On 5 April, the music video for Rosé's song "Gone" was released.

            In September 2021, Rosé was invited by Saint Laurent creative director Anthony Vaccarello as an accompaniment to the Met Gala, held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute in New York City. Her attendance at the annual fundraising event resulted her to become the first female K-pop idol to attend the Met Gala, alongside CL.

            In December 2021, Rosé announced her collaboration with the mediation and sleep app Calm, which includes her own bedtime story titled “Grounded With Rosé” on the app.
